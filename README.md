#Clone

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/prevostcorentin/pacman-rezurexion
```

#Compiling

Compiling debug and release target without dependencies:
```
make
```

Compile dependencies (if it works)
```
make dependencies
```

Compilation will not work on window command prompt. You must use CMDer or Cygwin to compile it with windows.

In other case, use an IDE like Code::Blocks or CodeLite, it should work if you know what you are doing.
